Concurrency: There are multiple scenarios that will give place to concurrency issues (some easier to manage that others):\
• Multiple instructors can create exams for the same subject simultaneously.\
• Multiple instructors can update the same exam simultaneously.\
• Multiple instructors can enter marks for the same student cohort simultaneously (in the
table view).\
• Multiple instructors can enter marks for the same exam and the same student (in the
detailed view) simultaneously.

Security: We implement the following security patterns: Authentication, Authorization, and Secure Pipe.
